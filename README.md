# Here's a brief explanation of the code that i had used in making this project..... 

#- The component defines a state variable called data using the useState hook to store the chart data.

#- The fetchData function is called when a button is clicked. It makes an HTTP request using axios to retrieve text content from a specific URL.

#- The fetched content is processed to calculate the frequency of each word.

#- The top 20 words with the highest frequency are selected and their frequency data is stored in an array.

#- The chart data is prepared by creating an object with options and series configuration for the chart.

#- The chartData object is set as the state using the setData function.

#- The handleExport function is called when another button is clicked. It converts the chart data into a CSV format and triggers a file download.

#- The component renders a container with a "Submit" button for fetching data.

#- If the data state is available, a chart is rendered using the Chart component from react-apexcharts.

#- The chart is displayed along with an "Export" button for downloading the data as a CSV file.

#- Then, I had used some CSS for styling my app like, in styling the chart, button and many more components that i had written in my App.css File.

##- These all code fetches text data, analyzes word frequency, and visualizes the results in a bar chart using React and the react-apexcharts library.



















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
